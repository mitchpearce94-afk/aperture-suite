If you've been using Studio Ninja for a few years, you probably remember when it felt like the answer to everything. Leads, quotes, contracts, invoices — all in one place, built specifically for photographers. It was good.

Then ImageQuix acquired it.

If you've spent any time in the Studio Ninja Community Facebook group lately, you know what happened next. Feature requests that have been "on the roadmap" for two years are still sitting there, untouched. Support tickets take 5 days to get a reply. The mobile app has had the same bugs since 2023. Photographers who championed Studio Ninja for years are quietly moving on.

If that's you — or if you're just starting out and doing your research — this post will save you a lot of time. We've gone through every major alternative, compared them honestly, and put the pricing side-by-side so you can make a call.

## Why Photographers Are Leaving Studio Ninja

To understand what you need in an alternative, it helps to understand exactly what's frustrating people.

**Support has collapsed.** The Australian photographer community used to rave about Studio Ninja's support. Post-acquisition, that's changed. Waiting 5+ days for a response that doesn't solve the problem is now the norm.

**Development has stalled.** Studio Ninja hasn't shipped a meaningful new feature in over 18 months. Features that were publicly announced are still pending. The product is essentially in maintenance mode.

**Nothing integrates with anything.** Studio Ninja manages your leads and jobs — but your galleries are in Pic-Time, your editing is in Aftershoot or Lightroom, and you're manually copying information between systems every single day.

**It doesn't automate enough.** You still have to manually send invoices, manually follow up with leads, manually send gallery delivery emails. For a "business management" tool, there's a surprising amount of business you're still managing yourself.

## The Alternatives: A Honest Look

### HoneyBook
**What it is:** A general creative business CRM — not built specifically for photographers.  
**Price:** ~$39-79/mo AUD (doubled in 2025)  
**Pros:** Polished UI, solid contract and invoice tools, decent automation  
**Cons:** Not photography-specific (no gallery delivery, no AI editing). Doubled their prices last year and photographers noticed. If you're doing fewer than 50 weddings a year, hard to justify.

**Best for:** Photographers who also do other creative work (design, video) and want one tool across everything.

### Dubsado
**What it is:** Another general CRM — popular with service businesses of all kinds.  
**Price:** ~$24/mo AUD  
**Pros:** Cheap, highly customisable, good automation workflows  
**Cons:** Has a brutal learning curve. Not built for photographers, so you'll spend days setting it up to work the way you need. No gallery delivery, no AI editing. Looks dated.

**Best for:** Photographers who want cheap and don't mind doing significant setup work.

---

### Sprout Studio
**What it is:** An all-in-one CRM + gallery platform for photographers.  
**Price:** ~$59-99/mo AUD  
**Pros:** Combines CRM and gallery delivery — that's a genuine step forward  
**Cons:** Users frequently report reliability issues. The interface is busy. No AI editing. Reviews are mixed on whether the "all-in-one" actually works well enough to justify it over separate tools.

**Best for:** Photographers who want CRM + galleries together and are willing to work around the rough edges.

---

### Pic-Time + Studio Ninja (or another CRM)
**What it is:** The most common combination Australian photographers are running right now.  
**Price:** $40+/mo for Pic-Time + whatever your CRM costs = $80-150/mo total  
**Pros:** Both tools do their individual job well  
**Cons:** You're still running two completely separate systems. There's no connection between your CRM and your gallery delivery. You're copying client information manually. You're paying for two subscriptions. And you still need something for AI editing if you want that.

**Best for:** Photographers who want best-in-class individual tools and don't mind the manual overhead.

### Apelier *(new — currently in early access)*
**What it is:** The only platform that combines CRM, gallery delivery, AND AI photo editing in one system.  
**Price:** $39-$279/mo AUD (free 14-day trial, no credit card)  

This is the one that actually solves the underlying problem: photographers are running 3 separate tools that don't talk to each other, paying $80-150/mo, and still doing a huge amount manually.

Apelier's workflow looks like this:
1. A lead fills in your booking page → CRM entry is created automatically
2. Contract is sent automatically, signed digitally
3. Invoice is sent automatically with deposit/final split
4. After the shoot, you upload your RAWs
5. AI edits them in your style (trained from just 50 of your images — not 5,000)
6. You review, approve, and hit send
7. Client gets their gallery. Automatic delivery email, automatic follow-up for reviews.

From upload to client delivery in under an hour. That's the claim, and the AI pipeline is running.

Apelier is built by an Australian founder (Brisbane-based) and is launching in 2026. The signup flow and Stripe integration aren't live yet, but the waitlist is open and founding members get 30% off for life.

## Who Should Switch to What

**If you just want something similar to Studio Ninja but more reliable:** Look at Dubsado or HoneyBook. Neither is photography-specific, but both are actively developed and stable.

**If you want CRM + galleries combined:** Sprout Studio is the current best option. Just go in with realistic expectations about reliability.

**If you want to stop paying for multiple tools and get AI editing included:** Apelier is the only option in this category. It's in early access — join the waitlist and lock in the founding member rate.

## The Bottom Line

The honest answer: there's no perfect Studio Ninja replacement that's been around for years and has thousands of happy users. The category hasn't caught up to what photographers actually need.

What is emerging — and what Apelier is building — is the next version of what Studio Ninja tried to be: a single platform that handles the whole workflow, including the editing that takes up most of your time.

If you're moving off Studio Ninja right now and need something today, HoneyBook or Dubsado for CRM + Pic-Time for galleries is the most stable combination.

If you're willing to join early access and want to stop duct-taping three tools together — that's what Apelier is for.
