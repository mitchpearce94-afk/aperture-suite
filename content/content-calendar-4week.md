## WEEK 1 — Awareness: The Problem

**Theme:** Name the pain. Every post this week validates frustrations photographers already have.

---

### Monday

**Platform:** Facebook Groups (Australian Wedding Photographers, Photography Business Secrets Australia)  
**Type:** Value post  
**Best time:** 8:30am AEST

**Caption:**
Honest question for anyone who's been in the game more than 3 years —

How long does your average wedding take you from upload to gallery delivery?

I've been asking this a lot lately and the answers are pretty confronting. Most photographers I talk to say 4-6 weeks. Some say 8+.

Not because they're slow. Because:
- Culling 2,500 shots takes half a day
- Editing takes another 10-15 hours
- Life gets in the way during peak season
- Then you've got 3 more weddings stacking up behind it

I used to think the answer was outsourcing editing. Then I started tracking how much that was actually costing me ($150-200 per wedding adds up fast).

What's your current turnaround time? And what's your editing setup?

*(No pitch. Genuinely curious — building something to solve this and want to hear real experiences.)*

---

### Tuesday

**Platform:** Instagram  
**Type:** Reel  
**Best time:** 7:00pm AEST  
**Visual:** Screen recording or talking head — "what editing actually looks like at 11pm on a Sunday"

**Script:**
*[HOOK — first 3 seconds]*
"This is what Sunday night looks like when you're 3 weddings behind on editing."

*[MIDDLE]*
"You're not slow. You're not disorganised. You just chose a job where the work doesn't stop when the shooting does.

Culling 2,500 images. Editing for 12 hours. Exporting. Uploading. Emailing. Repeating.

Meanwhile your clients are waiting 6 weeks for photos from what was probably the most important day of their lives."

*[END]*
"There's a better way coming. Follow for updates."

**Caption:**
The editing backlog is real and nobody talks about it enough 📸

If you're a wedding photographer in peak season, you know the Sunday-night spiral. Three weddings to edit, one already overdue, and it's midnight.

You didn't get into photography to spend your weekends glued to Lightroom.

Something's coming that changes this. Follow along 👇

### Wednesday

**Platform:** TikTok  
**Type:** Short-form (repurposed Tuesday Reel)  
**Best time:** 8:00pm AEST

**Script:**
"Wedding photographers — be honest. How far behind are you on galleries right now?

Because I've been talking to photographers all week and the numbers are wild.

4 weeks. 6 weeks. One person said 12 weeks. Twelve.

You're not failing at your job. Your tools are failing you.

Follow for the fix."

### Thursday

**Platform:** Instagram  
**Type:** Carousel  
**Best time:** 7:00pm AEST  
**Visual:** Slide deck — "The real cost of running 3 separate tools"

**Slide 1:** "Most wedding photographers are paying for 3 separate tools and they still don't talk to each other."

**Slide 2:** "CRM (Studio Ninja / HoneyBook): $25-39/mo → manages leads, contracts, invoices"

**Slide 3:** "Client Galleries (Pic-Time / Pixieset): $30-40/mo → delivers photos to clients"

**Slide 4:** "AI Editing (Aftershoot / Imagen): $16-50/mo → edits photos (sort of)"

**Slide 5:** "Total: $71-129/mo AUD — and none of them are connected. You're copying client info manually between all three."

**Slide 6:** "There's a single platform that combines all three. Launching 2026. Follow for updates → @apelier.au"

**Caption:**
Running three tools that don't talk to each other is costing you money AND time 💸

Swipe to see what the average photography business is actually spending — and what they're getting for it.

We're building the alternative. One platform. CRM + galleries + AI editing. Australian-made.

### Friday

**Platform:** Facebook Groups + Instagram Story  
**Type:** Poll / engagement post  
**Best time:** 8:00am AEST (FB) / 7:00pm AEST (Story)

**Facebook Groups caption:**
Quick poll — which tool frustrates you most?

🔵 Studio Ninja — support has gone downhill
🟡 HoneyBook — too expensive for what it does  
🟢 Pic-Time / Pixieset — great gallery, doesn't connect to CRM
🔴 Aftershoot / Imagen — doesn't edit like MY style
⚪ Something else — drop it in comments

*(Genuinely building something to fix this — trying to understand where the biggest pain is.)*

## WEEK 2 — Education: The Solution Exists

**Theme:** Introduce AI editing and the concept of an integrated workflow. Lead with education, not promotion.

---

### Monday

**Platform:** Facebook Groups  
**Type:** Value post — tip  
**Best time:** 9:00am AEST

**Caption:**
Something I learned the hard way about AI photo editing 👇

Most photographers give up on AI tools before they actually work.

Here's why: every AI editing tool needs training data — images you've already edited in your style. The more consistent and on-brand those images are, the better the AI learns.

The problem: most tools ask for 3,000-5,000 images. That's YEARS of shooting.

The workaround: you actually don't need that many. You need consistency, not volume. 50-100 well-selected RAW + edited pairs can produce results that look like you — if the tool is designed properly.

The trap to avoid: using images from different eras of your style. The AI will learn an average, not your current look. Stick to your last 12 months of work.

Happy to answer questions if anyone's currently trying to set up AI editing. Done a lot of trial and error on this.

### Tuesday

**Platform:** Instagram  
**Type:** Reel  
**Best time:** 7:00pm AEST  
**Visual:** Before/after of a wedding photo, AI edited

**Script:**
*[HOOK]*
"This photo was edited by AI. It took 4 minutes for 200 images."

*[MIDDLE]*
"Not a filter. Not a preset applied to everything. An AI trained on the photographer's actual work — their colour grading, their shadows, their skin tones.

The result? Edits that look like them. Not like a template.

The catch? Most AI editing tools need 3,000 to 5,000 training images before they get close.

We think that's backwards. You should be able to train an AI on 50 images and have it ready for your next shoot."

*[END]*
"That's what we're building at Apelier. Link in bio."

**Caption:**
AI edited. 200 photos. 4 minutes. ✨

Before you say "but it won't look like MY style" — that's exactly the problem we're solving.

Most AI tools need thousands of training images. We think 50 should be enough.

### Wednesday

**Platform:** TikTok  
**Best time:** 7:30pm AEST

**Script:**
"Here's something no AI editing company will tell you upfront.

Their tool needs 3,000 to 5,000 of YOUR images before it learns your style.

For most wedding photographers, that's 3-5 years of shooting — consistently, in the same style, with the same editing.

Imagen. Aftershoot. Same story.

The question isn't 'can AI learn your style?' It can.

The question is whether the barrier to entry is realistic for actual photographers.

We think 50 images should be enough. Follow to see how."

## WEEK 3 — Proof: Show the Product

**Theme:** Product demos, behind-the-scenes, founder credibility. Make it real.

---

### Monday

**Platform:** Facebook Groups  
**Type:** Value post — founder story angle  
**Best time:** 8:30am AEST

**Caption:**
I've been lurking in this group for a while before posting this.

I'm Mitchell — I'm a developer, not a photographer, but I've spent 12 months sitting with photographers (friends, family, people in groups like this) trying to understand what's actually broken about how the industry works.

What I kept hearing:

"I'm paying for three tools and none of them talk to each other."
"I spend more time editing than I do shooting."
"Studio Ninja used to be great. Now it just... isn't."
"I can't train AI tools — they all need 5,000 images."

So I built Apelier. CRM + gallery delivery + AI editing, in one platform, trained from 50 images.

It's in early access. I'm not pitching you anything today — just introducing myself. If you're curious, you can check it out at apelier.com.au. If you've got questions about how we've approached any of this, I'm genuinely happy to talk through it.

### Tuesday

**Platform:** Instagram  
**Type:** Reel — product demo  
**Best time:** 7:00pm AEST  
**Visual:** Screen recording of Apelier dashboard: lead → job → contract → invoice → gallery

**Script:**
*[HOOK]*
"I want to show you what happens when a lead books a wedding through Apelier."

*[WALKTHROUGH]*
"They hit the booking page. Fill in their details. Hit confirm.

The job is created automatically. The contract goes out automatically — ready for e-signature. The invoice is generated with deposit and final payment split, already scheduled.

No data entry. No copying names between tabs. No forgetting to send the contract.

After the shoot — upload the RAWs. AI edits in your style in the cloud. You review, approve, and the gallery delivers itself — with a follow-up email asking for a review.

That's it. The whole thing."

*[END]*
"Early access 2026. Link in bio."

**Caption:**
From inquiry to delivered gallery — automated 📸

This is what the workflow looks like inside Apelier. One platform. Zero tab-switching.

CRM → contracts → invoices → AI editing → gallery delivery → automated follow-up.

### Wednesday

**Platform:** TikTok  
**Best time:** 8:00pm AEST

**Script:**
"What if booking a wedding created the contract automatically?

And the contract auto-sent for signature?

And the invoice split into deposit and final payment on its own?

And after you uploaded the RAWs, the AI edited them and the gallery delivered itself?

That's Apelier. One platform. Zero manual steps.

Early access 2026. Follow for updates."

**Best time:** 6:00am AEST

**Slide 1:** "Why photographers are leaving Studio Ninja (and what they're going to instead)"

**Slide 2:** "Studio Ninja was great — until ImageQuix acquired it. Now: slow support, stalled development, features promised for years that never shipped."

**Slide 3:** "The alternatives: HoneyBook (not photography-specific, expensive), Dubsado (steep learning curve), Sprout Studio (right idea, mixed reviews)"

**Slide 4:** "None of them include AI editing. All of them still require you to manage a separate gallery platform."

**Slide 5:** "Apelier is the first platform that combines CRM + galleries + AI editing. Australian-made. Launching 2026."

**Slide 6:** "Pricing: $39 / $109 / $279 per month AUD. Free 14-day trial, no credit card."

## Facebook Group Response Templates

### When someone asks "What CRM should I use?"

> I've been using [CRM name] for a while but recently started moving things over to Apelier — it's an Australian platform that combines CRM, gallery delivery, and AI editing in one place. Still in early access but the waitlist is open at apelier.com.au if you want to take a look. Otherwise for right now, [honest recommendation based on context] works well for most people.

### When someone complains about Studio Ninja

> Yeah, the post-acquisition experience has been rough. A lot of people in this group are moving. If you want a like-for-like CRM replacement, [Dubsado/HoneyBook/Sprout] is worth a look. If you want something that also handles galleries and AI editing, there's an Australian platform called Apelier launching this year — waitlist is at apelier.com.au.

### When someone asks about AI editing tools

> Depends on your volume and how many edited images you have. Aftershoot is solid but local-only (your laptop cops it). Imagen is good but needs 3,000-5,000 training images. There's a new Australian platform called Apelier that only needs 50 images to train — worth checking out if you're not high-volume yet. apelier.com.au
