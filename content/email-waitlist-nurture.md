# Apelier Waitlist Email Nurture Sequence
*5 emails — from signup to founding member offer*

## Email 1 — Immediate (Send on signup)

**Subject:** You're on the list 👋 Here's what Apelier actually is

**Preview text:** Not a filter. Not a preset. Something a lot more useful.

---

Hey [First Name],

You just joined the Apelier waitlist. Good call.

Before we get into the polished marketing version of what Apelier is, let me just tell you plainly.

**Apelier is one platform that replaces the three tools most photographers are currently paying for:**

1. Your CRM (Studio Ninja, HoneyBook, Dubsado — pick your frustration)
2. Your gallery delivery platform (Pic-Time, Pixieset, etc.)
3. Your AI photo editing tool (Aftershoot, Imagen, or "I do it manually and it's killing me")

The problem with having three separate tools isn't just cost (though that adds up — most photographers spend $80-150/mo across all three). It's that none of them talk to each other. You're manually copying client details. You're logging into four different things to manage one booking. You finish a shoot and then you have hours of editing before you can even think about delivering the gallery.

Apelier connects all of it. You add the lead, they book, everything else runs automatically — contracts, invoices, AI editing in your style, gallery delivery, follow-up emails.

From upload to gallery delivery: under an hour.

We're launching in 2026. Between now and then, I'm going to send you a few emails that go deeper on the parts of this that matter most.

Nothing spammy. Just the actual substance.

## Email 2 — Day 3

**Subject:** You're probably paying $120/month for three tools that hate each other

**Preview text:** Here's the actual maths.

---

Hey [First Name],

Let me show you something.

Here's what the average Australian wedding photographer is paying for their software setup right now:

| Tool | What it does | Monthly cost |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Studio Ninja (or similar CRM) | Leads, contracts, invoices | $25-35 |
| Pic-Time / Pixieset | Client gallery delivery | $30-40 |
| Aftershoot / Imagen | AI photo editing | $16-50 |
| **Total** | **Three separate logins** | **$71-125/mo** |

And here's the part the pricing pages don't show you: those three tools don't connect. At all.

When a client books, you enter their details into your CRM. Then you manually re-enter them into your gallery platform. Then you export edited photos out of your AI tool, import them into your gallery platform, and manually send the delivery email.

Every step. Every wedding. Every time.

I've had photographers tell me they have a Zapier workflow stitching things together. Those work until they don't — and debugging a broken automation at 11pm when a client is waiting for their gallery is its own special kind of awful.

Apelier is one platform. One login. The client books → everything flows through automatically. CRM entry, contract, invoice, AI editing, gallery delivery, follow-up. Nothing manual between those steps.

**Apelier pricing when we launch:**
- Starter: $39/mo — 2,000 AI edits, 1 style profile
- Pro: $109/mo — 10,000 AI edits, unlimited style profiles
- Studio: $279/mo — 25,000 AI edits, multi-shooter, white-label

For most photographers: $39-109/mo. For everything.

More on the AI editing specifically in a few days — that's the part most people have questions about.

## Email 3 — Day 7

**Subject:** How Apelier's AI learns YOUR editing style (not a generic preset)

**Preview text:** 50 images. Not 5,000.

---

Hey [First Name],

The most common question I get when I explain Apelier is: "But will the AI actually edit like me? Or will it just apply some generic look?"

Fair question. Here's the honest answer.

**Why most AI editing tools don't look like you**

Tools like Imagen are genuinely impressive — but they need 3,000 to 5,000 edited image pairs before they reliably capture your style. That's years of consistently-edited shooting. If you're newer to the industry, or if your style has evolved recently, you're essentially starting from zero.

Aftershoot is good but runs locally on your computer. If you shoot 2,500 frames at a wedding, that's your laptop tied up processing overnight.

Both tools also exist in isolation. They don't connect to your CRM, your gallery delivery, or your booking system. You still have to do everything else manually.

**How Apelier approaches it**

Apelier's AI learns from as few as 50 RAW + edited image pairs. Here's why that's possible:

We're not trying to learn everything from your images alone. We use a combination of scene understanding (what kind of shot is this? outdoor ceremony? dark reception? golden hour portraits?) and your style pairs to predict corrections that match your look, not ours.

The result: an AI that understands your editing decisions in context — not just "she edits warm" but "she edits warm in outdoor shots, cooler in reception shots, and lifts shadows specifically in backlit images."

**What the review process looks like**

After your images are processed, you get a review workspace — before/after comparison for every image. You can approve, reject, or flag for manual edit. The ones you reject feed back into the model over time.

Nothing goes to your client without your sign-off.

**The training process**

1. You upload 50 RAW files + your edited versions of those same images
2. Apelier trains your style profile (takes a few hours)
3. Your next upload gets edited in your style
4. As you review and give feedback, it keeps improving

That's it.

## Email 4 — Day 14

**Subject:** Why I built this (the real version)

**Preview text:** A developer building software for photographers. Here's how that happened.

---

Hey [First Name],

Quick one today — the actual story of why Apelier exists.

I'm not a photographer. I'm a developer and builder, and I've been watching the photography software market for a while.

What I saw was a category that hadn't really moved in years. Studio Ninja was the dominant tool in Australia. Then ImageQuix acquired it, and over the following 18 months, the community went from "Studio Ninja is the best" to "features that were promised three years ago are still on the roadmap."

Meanwhile, AI editing tools were emerging — but they were either local (limited by your laptop) or required training data that most photographers couldn't realistically provide. And none of them connected to anything. You'd still be running separate tools for CRM, galleries, and editing, and manually bridging the gaps between all of them.

The problem I kept coming back to: photographers are time-poor. They're running a creative business, a client service business, and a technical post-production workflow all at once. The tools they have make all three of those things harder than they need to be.

So I built Apelier.

Not to be the next Studio Ninja. To be what comes after it.

One platform. Full workflow. AI that learns your style from 50 images. Gallery delivery that runs itself. CRM that handles the business side so you can focus on the shooting.

I've been building this for about 12 months. The product is nearly ready. The waitlist — which you're on — is where I'll be launching.

I'm sharing founding member pricing with the first 100 people who sign up when we open. More on that in the next email.

Thanks for being here.

## Email 5 — Day 21

**Subject:** Founding member pricing — 30% off for life (closes at 100 spots)

**Preview text:** $27/mo instead of $39. $76/mo instead of $109. Locked in forever.

---

Hey [First Name],

We're opening founding member pricing.

100 spots. 30% off every month, for as long as you use Apelier. Locked in before we launch.

Here's what that looks like in numbers:

| Plan | Regular price | Founding member price | Annual saving |
|------|-------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Starter | $39/mo | **$27/mo** | $144/year |
| Pro | $109/mo | **$76/mo** | $396/year |
| Studio | $279/mo | **$195/mo** | $1,008/year |

And the features don't get limited. You get everything — the same plan, the same AI editing, the same platform — just at 30% off permanently.

**Why founding member pricing?**

Honestly: the first 100 users shape the product. You'll have direct access to give feedback, request features, and influence what we build. That's worth something. This is the way I'm acknowledging it.

**What happens next:**

1. When Stripe and the signup flow go live (soon), you'll get an email with your founding member link
2. You lock in your pricing before anyone else
3. You get priority onboarding
4. You can upgrade or downgrade anytime — the 30% always stays

You're already on the list. You don't need to do anything else today.

But if you know another photographer who'd want in on founding member pricing, send them to apelier.com.au. The 100 spots are first-come, first-served.

Thanks for being here from the start. I genuinely appreciate it.
