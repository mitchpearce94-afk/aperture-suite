# Apelier Hero Video Script
**Title:** "From Shutter to Delivery in Under 1 Hour"  
**Length:** ~90 seconds (~225 words spoken)  
**Format:** Voiceover + screen recording / HeyGen production  
**Tone:** Confident, direct, insider — not salesy

---

## Production Notes

- Open on problem (emotional hook) — don't show product until 15-20 seconds in
- Screen recordings: Apelier dashboard, booking page, review workspace, gallery view
- Use real wedding photos for before/after if possible (with permission)
- Music: subtle, modern, not dramatic — underscore that lifts slightly at the resolution section
- Captions: on by default (most social video is watched muted)
- End card: apelier.com.au + "Join the waitlist"

## Script

---

**[SCENE: Dark screen. Text appears word by word.]**

*VOICEOVER:*

"It's Sunday night. You have three weddings to edit.

One client has been waiting six weeks.

You shot 2,600 frames on Saturday. Culling alone will take half a day.

This isn't bad time management. This is just the job — for most photographers."

**[CUT TO: Clean product dashboard — Apelier UI. Warm, minimal, professional.]**

"But here's what it looks like when the workflow actually works.

A couple visits your booking page.

They pick their date, sign the contract, pay the deposit —

all without you touching a thing."

**[SCENE: Booking confirmation screen → contract auto-generated → invoice split view]**

"The contract is sent automatically. The invoice splits into deposit and final payment.

Your CRM updates. Your calendar blocks the date.

You just got booked. You didn't lift a finger."

**[SCENE: Upload screen — RAW files being dragged in]**

"After the shoot, you upload your RAWs.

Apelier's AI — trained on your editing style — goes to work in the cloud."

**[SCENE: Progress indicator → review workspace with before/after sliders]**

"Not a filter. Not a generic preset. Your look. From 50 of your images.

200 photos, edited, in under an hour.

You review. You approve. You hit send."

**[SCENE: Client gallery — clean, watermarked, beautiful. Gallery delivery email shown.]**

"Your client gets a stunning gallery.

The delivery email goes automatically. So does the follow-up asking for a review.

You didn't write either of them."

**[SCENE: Timeline graphic — "Old way: 4-8 weeks. Apelier: under 1 hour."]**

"From shutter click to client delivery.

Under one hour.

Not four weeks. Not six. One hour."

**[END CARD: Apelier logo. Dark background, gold text.]**

**TEXT ON SCREEN:** "Apelier — CRM + Galleries + AI Editing"  
**TEXT ON SCREEN:** "Free 14-day trial. No credit card."  
**TEXT ON SCREEN:** "apelier.com.au"

*VOICEOVER:*

"Apelier. One platform. Free trial at apelier.com.au."

## Alternate Hook Versions (A/B test)

**Hook A (used above):**
"It's Sunday night. You have three weddings to edit."

**Hook B (more direct):**
"Most photographers deliver galleries 4-8 weeks after the shoot. We think that should take an hour."

**Hook C (community angle):**
"Wedding photographers — how long is your current editing backlog? For most people in the groups I'm in, the answer is weeks."

## Cut-Down Versions

### 30-second cut (for paid ads)

"You shot 2,000 photos on Saturday. By Tuesday, your client could have their gallery.

Apelier automatically books, invoices, AI-edits in your style, and delivers — without you managing any of it.

CRM. Galleries. AI editing. One platform.

Free trial at apelier.com.au."

### 15-second cut (Instagram Story / TikTok ad)

"Upload your RAWs. AI edits 200 photos in your style in under an hour. Gallery delivers itself.

That's Apelier. Free trial. apelier.com.au."

*Produce the 90-second version first. Cut-downs are derived from the same footage.*
